You won't find this in old HTML tutorials, but it's extremely useful.
The *BANE* of old HTML sites is keeping things updates across multiple pages.
It's really impossible without something like this. 
I tried something similar with JS injection many years ago, but web components provide official support.
I'll keep it super simple, but keep in mind that any re-used components should be put in here to keep pages clean and updated.
