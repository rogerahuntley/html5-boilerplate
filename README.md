# HTML5 Boilerplate

This is my own basic starting point, I've always loved to tinker with basic HTML5 and I think it's good to have a basic starting point.
This project provides a couple examples of 'modern' web standards used in a sane way while also being completely static and 'near metal'.

```
This is like Web 1.0 w/ modern HTML5

## Getting Started

In this project there are paths that run relative to the root folder of the site, but if you just open index.html it doesnâ€™t know the root folder so it will run relative to your C: drive (or equivalent).
- I use VS-Code with an extension called Live Server.
- There are terminal options as well, such as http-server.
